# 00 - Python Basics

Welcome to the first module of our AI workshop! This section covers fundamental Python programming concepts that form the foundation for everything we'll build later.

## What You'll Learn

- **Conditional Statements**: Making decisions in your code
- **Loops**: Repeating code efficiently
- **Command Line Interface**: Building interactive programs

## Files in This Module

### 1. `conditional_statements.py`
Learn how to make decisions in your code using:
- `if`, `elif`, `else` statements
- Comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, etc.)
- Logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)
- String comparison methods (`.lower()`, `.upper()`, `.title()`)

**Key Concepts:**
- Boolean logic and truthiness
- String methods for case-insensitive comparisons
- Input validation techniques

### 2. `loops.py`
Master repetition in Python with:
- `for` loops with `range()`
- Iterating over lists and strings
- Using `enumerate()` to get index and value
- List operations and methods

**Key Concepts:**
- Different ways to iterate through data
- List indexing and length
- When to use different loop patterns

## Running the Code

To run any of these examples:

```bash
python conditional_statements.py
python loops.py
```

## Setup for CLI Example

1. Create virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## Exercises

1. **Conditional Practice**: Modify `conditional_statements.py` to create a simple age verification system
2. **Loop Challenge**: Use `loops.py` to create a multiplication table

## Next Steps

Once you're comfortable with these basics, move on to **01-data-types-variables** to learn about Python's data structures and type system!
